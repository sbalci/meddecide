Description: A comprehensive toolkit for medical decision analysis and
        reliability assessment, implemented as a jamovi module. The
        package provides tools for: * Interrater and intrarater
        reliability analysis using Cohen's Kappa and Fleiss' Kappa
        statistics * Diagnostic test evaluation with sensitivity,
        specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios * Sample
        size calculations for reliability studies using confidence
        interval and power-based approaches * Visualization tools
        including Fagan nomograms for Bayesian probability updates *
        Power analysis for interobserver agreement studies with support
        for multiple raters and outcome categories Tools are provided
        through an intuitive graphical interface in jamovi, making
        complex medical decision analyses accessible to clinical
        researchers.
