Description: A comprehensive toolkit for medical decision analysis and reliability 
    assessment, implemented as a jamovi module. The package provides tools for:
    * Interrater and intrarater reliability analysis using Cohen's Kappa and 
      Fleiss' Kappa statistics
    * Diagnostic test evaluation with sensitivity, specificity, predictive values,
      and likelihood ratios
    * Sample size calculations for reliability studies using confidence interval
      and power-based approaches
    * Visualization tools including Fagan nomograms for Bayesian probability 
      updates
    * Power analysis for interobserver agreement studies with support for 
      multiple raters and outcome categories
    Tools are provided through an intuitive graphical interface in jamovi, making
    complex medical decision analyses accessible to clinical researchers.
