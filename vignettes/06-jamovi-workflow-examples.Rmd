# Overview

This vignette provides step-by-step workflows for using the generated datasets in jamovi with the ClinicoPath decision analysis modules.

# Load Data in jamovi

## Step 1: Open jamovi and Import Data

1. **Open jamovi**
2. **Import data file:**
   - File → Open → Browse to:
   - `appendicitis_decision_tree.csv` (for decision tree)
   - `heart_disease_markov.csv` (for Markov chain)
   - Or use any of the test datasets in `inst/extdata/`

# Decision Tree Analysis Workflow

## Using: appendicitis_decision_tree.csv

### Step 1: Navigate to Analysis

1. **Navigate to:** ClinicoPath → meddecide → Decision → Decision Tree Graph

### Step 2: Configure Variables

Configure the following variables:

- **Decision Nodes:** `treatment_choice`
- **Probability Variables:** `prob_surgery_success`, `prob_conservative_success`
- **Cost Variables:** `cost_surgery`, `cost_conservative`, `cost_complications`
- **Utility Variables:** `utility_success`, `utility_minor_complications`
- **Outcome Variables:** `clinical_outcome`

### Step 3: Set Tree Structure

- **Tree Type:** Cost-Effectiveness Tree
- **Layout:** Horizontal (Left to Right)

### Step 4: Configure Display Options

Enable the following options:

- ☑ Show Node Shapes
- ☑ Show Probabilities  
- ☑ Show Costs
- ☑ Show Utilities
- ☑ Show Node Labels
- ☑ Show Branch Labels
- **Color Scheme:** Medical Theme

### Step 5: Configure Analysis Options

- ☑ Calculate Expected Values
- ☐ Sensitivity Analysis (optional)
- **Discount Rate:** 3%
- **Time Horizon:** 1 year

### Step 6: Configure Output Options

- ☑ Summary Table
- ☐ Tornado Diagram (if sensitivity analysis enabled)

## Expected Decision Tree Results

The analysis should produce:

- **Decision tree visualization** with nodes and branches
- **Expected values table** showing:
  - Strategy: Surgery vs Conservative
  - Expected Cost: ~$12,315 vs ~$7,454
  - Expected Utility: ~0.989 vs ~0.895 QALYs
  - ICER: ~$51,744 per QALY
  - Net Benefit: Varies by WTP threshold

## Clinical Interpretation

- Surgery costs $4,861 more but provides 0.094 additional QALYs
- ICER of $51,744/QALY suggests surgery is marginally cost-effective
- Decision depends on patient factors and willingness-to-pay threshold

# Markov Chain Analysis Workflow

## Using: heart_disease_markov.csv

### Step 1: Navigate to Analysis

1. **Navigate to:** ClinicoPath → meddecide → Decision → Decision Tree Graph

### Step 2: Configure Variables

Configure the following variables:

- **Decision Nodes:** `management_strategy`
- **Health States:** `management_strategy` (or create state variable)
- **Transition Probabilities:** `prob_asymp_to_symp`, `prob_symp_to_hf`, `prob_hf_to_death`
- **Cost Variables:** `cost_asymptomatic`, `cost_symptomatic`, `cost_heart_failure`
- **Utility Variables:** `utility_asymptomatic`, `utility_symptomatic`, `utility_heart_failure`

### Step 3: Set Tree Structure

- **Tree Type:** Markov Model Tree
- **Layout:** Horizontal (Left to Right)

### Step 4: Configure Markov Options

- **Cycle Length:** 1 year
- **Time Horizon:** 20 years

### Step 5: Configure Analysis Options

- ☑ Calculate Expected Values
- **Discount Rate:** 3%
- **Time Horizon:** 20 years

### Step 6: Configure Output Options

- ☑ Summary Table
- ☑ Cohort Trace Plot
- ☑ Transition Matrix

## Expected Markov Results

The analysis should produce:

- **Markov Transition Matrix** showing probabilities between states
- **Markov Cohort Analysis** showing population distribution over time:
  - Year 0: 100% Asymptomatic
  - Year 5: 54% Asymptomatic, 24% Symptomatic, 12% Heart Failure, 11% Dead
  - Year 20: 9% Asymptomatic, 7% Symptomatic, 16% Heart Failure, 68% Dead
- **Cost-effectiveness results:**
  - Total Lifetime Cost: ~$120,561
  - Total Lifetime QALYs: ~8.39
  - Cost per QALY: ~$14,370
- **Markov State Transitions plot** showing progression over time

## Clinical Interpretation

- Standard care provides good value at $14,370/QALY
- Disease progression shows 68% mortality at 20 years
- Peak heart failure prevalence around year 15
- Results support cost-effectiveness of standard care

# Comparing Strategies

## For Decision Trees

- Compare expected values in the Summary Table
- Look for dominant strategies (lower cost, higher utility)
- Calculate ICERs for non-dominated strategies
- Use sensitivity analysis to test robustness

## For Markov Models

- Run separate analyses for each strategy
- Compare lifetime costs and QALYs
- Calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
- Examine cohort traces to understand disease progression

# Sensitivity Analysis

## Step 1: Enable Sensitivity Analysis

1. Enable 'Sensitivity Analysis' in Analysis Options
2. Enable 'Tornado Diagram' in Output Options

## Step 2: Review Results

Results will show:

- Parameter ranges and their impact on outcomes
- Tornado diagram ranking parameters by influence
- Threshold values where conclusions change

# Interpreting Results

## Key Metrics to Report

- Expected costs (with confidence intervals)
- Expected utilities/QALYs
- ICERs with interpretation vs. thresholds
- Net benefit at relevant WTP thresholds
- Sensitivity analysis results

## Cost-Effectiveness Thresholds

- **< $50,000/QALY:** Highly cost-effective
- **$50,000-$100,000/QALY:** Moderately cost-effective
- **> $100,000/QALY:** Not cost-effective (US standards)
- Thresholds vary by country and healthcare system

# Reporting Results

## Include in Publications

- **Methods:** Model structure, data sources, assumptions
- **Results:** Base-case cost-effectiveness results
- **Sensitivity analysis:** Key drivers and uncertainty
- **Limitations:** Model assumptions and data limitations
- **Conclusions:** Policy implications and recommendations

## Visual Elements

- Decision tree or Markov model diagram
- Cost-effectiveness plane (cost vs. utility)
- Tornado diagram (for sensitivity analysis)
- Cohort trace plot (for Markov models)
