# 🚀 Quick Start: 5-Minute Diagnostic Style Analysis

## Step 1: Prepare Your Data

**Required columns:**
- **Rater columns**: Each pathologist's diagnoses (e.g., Path_01, Path_02, etc.)
- **Case ID**: Unique identifier for each case

**Optional columns:**
- **Experience**: Years of experience or level (Junior/Senior)
- **Training**: Training institution
- **Institution**: Current practice location
- **Specialty**: Subspecialty focus
- **True diagnosis**: Gold standard (for accuracy analysis)

## Step 2: Load Data in jamovi

1. Open jamovi
2. Import your CSV file
3. Ensure rater columns are set as **Factor** (nominal/ordinal)

## Step 3: Run Basic Analysis

1. Go to **meddecide** → **Agreement** → **Interrater Reliability**
2. Move rater columns to **Raters/Observers** box
3. Click **Run**

**✅ Check:** Overall agreement should be 40-90% for meaningful style analysis

## Step 4: Enable Diagnostic Style Clustering

1. Check **✓ Diagnostic Style Clustering (Usubutun Method)**
2. Accept defaults:
   - Method: Ward's Linkage
   - Distance: Percentage Agreement  
   - Groups: 3

**✅ Expected:** See Style Groups (1, 2, 3) assigned to each pathologist

## Step 5: Add Pathologist Characteristics

1. Check **✓ Include Rater Characteristics**
2. Select your characteristic variables:
   - Experience Variable → your experience column
   - Training Institution → your training column
   - Current Institution → your institution column
   - Specialty → your specialty column

**✅ Expected:** Style groups correlate with characteristics

## Step 6: Identify Problem Cases

1. Check **✓ Identify Discordant Cases**

**✅ Expected:** List of cases causing style-based disagreement

# 📊 Interpreting Results

## Diagnostic Style Table

| Rater | Style Group | Within-Group Agreement | Experience | Training |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|------------|----------|
| Path_01 | Style 1 | 85% | Senior | Academic |
| Path_02 | Style 1 | 83% | Senior | Academic |
| Path_03 | Style 2 | 78% | Junior | Community |

**🔍 What to look for:**
- **High within-group agreement** (>80%): Strong style membership
- **Similar characteristics within groups**: Validates clustering
- **Clear separation between groups**: Distinct diagnostic approaches

## Style Summary Table

| Style Group | Members | Avg Agreement | Predominant Training |
|-------------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Style 1 | 6 | 84% | Academic_Eastern |
| Style 2 | 5 | 79% | Community |
| Style 3 | 4 | 87% | Academic_Western |

**🔍 Interpretation:**
- **Style 1**: Conservative academics
- **Style 2**: Moderate community pathologists  
- **Style 3**: Aggressive specialists

## Discordant Cases

| Case | Discord Score | Style 1 Diagnosis | Style 2 Diagnosis | Style 3 Diagnosis |
|------|---------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Case_042 | 0.85 | Benign | Atypical | Atypical |
| Case_067 | 0.78 | Atypical | DCIS | DCIS |

**🔍 Meaning:**
- **High discord** (>0.7): Cases revealing diagnostic philosophy differences
- **Pattern**: Conservative vs. aggressive diagnostic tendencies

# 🎯 Common Applications

## Quality Assurance

**Goal**: Identify diagnostic outliers

**Setup:**
- Include all department pathologists
- Use routine sign-out cases
- Focus on challenging diagnoses

**Action Items:**
- Pathologists with unusual styles → additional training
- Cases with high discord → consensus review
- Style patterns → standardized protocols

## Training Evaluation

**Goal**: Assess resident diagnostic development

**Setup:**
- Compare residents vs. attendings
- Track individual residents over time
- Include mentor information

**Action Items:**
- Residents clustering with wrong style → mentor reassignment
- Persistent style differences → targeted education
- Mentor influence patterns → faculty development

## Consensus Development

**Goal**: Improve diagnostic guidelines

**Setup:**
- Select expert panel representing different styles
- Include cases showing style disagreements
- Document reasoning for style differences

**Action Items:**
- Style-specific guidelines → comprehensive protocols
- High-discord cases → educational materials
- Expert disagreements → research priorities

- 📊 Measures: Direct diagnostic concordance

**Correlation**
- ✅ Use for: Ordinal scales (grades, stages)
- 📊 Measures: Linear relationship patterns

**Euclidean**
- ✅ Use for: Quantitative scores
- 📊 Measures: Geometric distance

## Clustering Methods

**Ward's Linkage (Default)**
- ✅ Use for: Compact, similar-sized groups
- 🎯 Creates: Tight, meaningful clusters

**Complete Linkage**
- ✅ Use for: Well-separated distinct groups
- 🎯 Creates: Very tight clusters

**Average Linkage**
- ✅ Use for: Moderate separation
- 🎯 Creates: Balanced clusters

## Number of Groups

**2 Groups**: Conservative vs. Aggressive
**3 Groups**: Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive (Usubutun standard)
**4+ Groups**: Subspecialty-specific approaches

# 🔧 Troubleshooting

## Problem: All pathologists in one group

**Causes:**
- Too few pathologists (<6)
- Very high agreement
- Cases too easy/difficult

**Solutions:**
- Add more pathologists
- Include challenging cases
- Reduce groups to 2

## Problem: Groups don't match characteristics

**Causes:**
- Characteristics don't influence style
- Small sample size
- Hidden confounders

**Solutions:**
- Add more characteristic variables
- Increase case numbers
- Consider interaction effects

## Problem: Poor within-group agreement

**Causes:**
- Wrong number of groups
- High random error
- Inappropriate cases

**Solutions:**
- Adjust group number
- Focus on moderate difficulty cases
- Exclude technical failures

*💡 **Tip**: Start with the test datasets to learn the interface, then apply to your own data. The diagnostic style clustering reveals hidden patterns in pathologist decision-making that traditional agreement statistics miss.*
