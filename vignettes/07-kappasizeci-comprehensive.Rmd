# Introduction

The `kappasizeci` function provides statistical power analysis for interobserver agreement studies using Cohen's kappa statistic. This function calculates the required sample size to achieve a specified precision (confidence interval width) for kappa coefficient estimates in studies evaluating agreement between multiple raters or observers.

## What is Cohen's Kappa?

Cohen's kappa (κ) is a statistical measure of interobserver agreement for categorical items. It measures the agreement between raters while accounting for the possibility of chance agreement:

$$\kappa = \frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e}$$

Where:
- $p_o$ = observed proportional agreement
- $p_e$ = expected agreement by chance

**Kappa Interpretation Guidelines:**
- κ < 0.00: Poor agreement (worse than chance)
- κ = 0.00-0.20: Slight agreement  
- κ = 0.21-0.40: Fair agreement
- κ = 0.41-0.60: Moderate agreement
- κ = 0.61-0.80: Substantial agreement
- κ = 0.81-1.00: Almost perfect agreement

## Why Sample Size Calculation for Kappa?

Interobserver agreement studies require adequate sample sizes to:

1. **Ensure Precision**: Achieve narrow confidence intervals around kappa estimates
2. **Statistical Power**: Detect clinically meaningful differences in agreement
3. **Resource Planning**: Optimize study costs and logistics
4. **Regulatory Requirements**: Meet standards for validation studies
5. **Publication Standards**: Satisfy journal requirements for reliability studies

## Key Features of kappasizeci

- **Multiple Categories**: Supports 2-5 outcome categories
- **Flexible Rater Numbers**: Accommodates 2-5 raters
- **Confidence Interval Approach**: Focuses on precision rather than hypothesis testing
- **Real-world Applications**: Covers medical, psychological, and quality control scenarios
- **Performance Optimized**: Intelligent caching for repeated calculations

## Installation and Setup

```{r setup}
# Load required libraries

library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Set options for better output
options(digits = 3)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 12,
  fig.height = 8,
    dpi = 300,
  echo = TRUE,
  eval = FALSE,
  out.width = "100%"
)

# Check if required packages are available
if (!requireNamespace("kappaSize", quietly = TRUE)) {
  message("Note: kappaSize package required for sample size calculations")
  message("Install with: install.packages('kappaSize')")
}
```

# Understanding the Parameters

## Core Parameters

### Kappa Parameters
- **kappa0**: Null hypothesis value of kappa (expected agreement level)
- **kappaL**: Lower bound of desired confidence interval
- **kappaU**: Upper bound of desired confidence interval

The confidence interval [kappaL, kappaU] defines the precision requirement:
- Narrow intervals (e.g., ±0.05) require larger sample sizes
- Wide intervals (e.g., ±0.20) require smaller sample sizes

### Study Design Parameters
- **outcome**: Number of outcome categories (2, 3, 4, or 5)
- **raters**: Number of raters/observers (2, 3, 4, or 5)
- **props**: Proportions for each outcome category (must sum to 1.0)
- **alpha**: Significance level (typically 0.05)

## Parameter Relationships

```{r parameter-relationships}
# Create parameter relationship examples
param_examples <- data.frame(
  Study_Type = c(
    "High Precision",
    "Standard Precision", 
    "Lower Precision",

  )
)

```

# Basic Usage Examples

## Binary Outcomes (2 Categories)

The simplest case involves binary classifications (e.g., Disease/No Disease):

```{r binary-example}
# Example: Mammography screening agreement
# Two radiologists reviewing mammograms for suspicious findings

# Study parameters
binary_study <- list(
  description = "Mammography screening agreement study",
  outcome = "2",           # Binary: Suspicious / Not suspicious
  kappa0 = 0.75,          # Expected high agreement
  kappaL = 0.65,          # Lower confidence bound
  kappaU = 0.85,          # Upper confidence bound  
  props = "0.15, 0.85",   # 15% suspicious findings
  raters = "2",           # Two radiologists
  alpha = 0.05            # 5% significance level
)

# Display study design
cat("Study Design:\n")
cat("Purpose:", binary_study$description, "\n")
cat("Expected κ:", binary_study$kappa0, "\n") 
cat("Precision: ±", (as.numeric(binary_study$kappaU) - as.numeric(binary_study$kappaL))/2, "\n")
cat("Prevalence: 15% suspicious findings\n")
cat("Raters: 2 radiologists\n\n")

# In practice, you would call:
# result <- kappaSizeCI(
#   outcome = binary_study$outcome,
#   kappa0 = binary_study$kappa0, 
#   kappaL = binary_study$kappaL,
#   kappaU = binary_study$kappaU,
#   props = binary_study$props,
#   raters = binary_study$raters,
#   alpha = binary_study$alpha
# )

cat("Sample size calculation would be performed using kappaSize package\n")
```

### Understanding Binary Study Results

Key considerations for binary outcomes:
- **Prevalence Effects**: Rare conditions (low prevalence) typically require larger sample sizes
- **Agreement Expectations**: Higher expected kappa values may require larger samples for narrow confidence intervals
- **Clinical Context**: Diagnostic studies often require κ > 0.70 for clinical acceptability

## Three-Category Outcomes

Many clinical assessments use three-level classifications:

```{r three-category-example}
# Example: Cancer grading study
# Pathologists grading tumor differentiation

three_cat_study <- list(
  description = "Pathological tumor grading agreement",
  outcome = "3",                    # Three grades
  kappa0 = 0.70,                   # Good expected agreement
  kappaL = 0.60,                   # Lower bound
  kappaU = 0.80,                   # Upper bound
  props = "0.20, 0.50, 0.30",      # Well, Moderate, Poor differentiation
  raters = "3",                    # Three pathologists
  alpha = 0.05
)

cat("Three-Category Study Design:\n")
cat("Purpose:", three_cat_study$description, "\n")
cat("Categories: Well differentiated (20%), Moderate (50%), Poor (30%)\n")
cat("Expected κ:", three_cat_study$kappa0, "\n")
cat("Precision width:", as.numeric(three_cat_study$kappaU) - as.numeric(three_cat_study$kappaL), "\n")
cat("Raters: 3 pathologists\n\n")

# Parse proportions to show distribution
props_values <- as.numeric(strsplit(three_cat_study$props, ",")[[1]])
prop_labels <- c("Well differentiated", "Moderately differentiated", "Poorly differentiated")

prop_table <- data.frame(
  Category = prop_labels,
  Proportion = props_values,
  Percentage = paste0(props_values * 100, "%")
)

kable(prop_table, caption = "Expected Category Distributions")
```

## Four-Category Outcomes

Four-category systems are common in radiology and quality assessments:

```{r four-category-example}
# Example: BI-RADS assessment
# Radiologists using BI-RADS classification

four_cat_study <- list(
  description = "BI-RADS classification agreement study",
  outcome = "4",
  kappa0 = 0.75,
  kappaL = 0.65,
  kappaU = 0.85,
  props = "0.40, 0.30, 0.20, 0.10",  # BI-RADS 1, 2, 3, 4/5
  raters = "3",
  alpha = 0.05
)

cat("Four-Category Study Design:\n")
cat("Purpose:", four_cat_study$description, "\n")
cat("BI-RADS Categories:\n")

props_values <- as.numeric(strsplit(four_cat_study$props, ",")[[1]])
birads_labels <- c("BI-RADS 1 (Normal)", "BI-RADS 2 (Benign)", "BI-RADS 3 (Probably benign)", "BI-RADS 4/5 (Suspicious)")

birads_table <- data.frame(
  Category = birads_labels,
  Proportion = props_values,
  Percentage = paste0(props_values * 100, "%"),
  Clinical_Action = c("Routine screening", "Routine screening", "Short-term follow-up", "Biopsy recommended")
)

kable(birads_table, caption = "BI-RADS Category Distribution and Clinical Actions")
```

## Five-Category Outcomes

Five-category systems are often used in psychological assessments and Likert scales:

```{r five-category-example}
# Example: Pain assessment study
# Nurses rating pain using behavioral indicators

five_cat_study <- list(
  description = "Pediatric pain assessment agreement",
  outcome = "5",
  kappa0 = 0.60,                   # Moderate agreement expected for subjective assessment
  kappaL = 0.45,
  kappaU = 0.75,
  props = "0.20, 0.25, 0.25, 0.20, 0.10",  # No pain to severe pain
  raters = "3",
  alpha = 0.05
)

cat("Five-Category Study Design:\n")
cat("Purpose:", five_cat_study$description, "\n")

props_values <- as.numeric(strsplit(five_cat_study$props, ",")[[1]])
pain_labels <- c("No pain (0)", "Mild pain (1-3)", "Moderate pain (4-6)", "Severe pain (7-8)", "Extreme pain (9-10)")

pain_table <- data.frame(
  Pain_Level = pain_labels,
  Proportion = props_values,
  Percentage = paste0(props_values * 100, "%"),
  Intervention = c("None", "Non-pharmacological", "Mild analgesics", "Strong analgesics", "Immediate intervention")
