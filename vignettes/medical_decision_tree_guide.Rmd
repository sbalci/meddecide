## Clinical Interpretation Guidelines

### Performance Thresholds
- **Excellent**: Sensitivity/Specificity ≥ 0.90
- **Good**: Sensitivity/Specificity ≥ 0.80
- **Adequate**: Sensitivity/Specificity ≥ 0.70
- **Poor**: Sensitivity/Specificity < 0.70

### Likelihood Ratio Interpretation
- **LR+ ≥ 10**: Strong evidence for disease
- **LR+ 5-10**: Moderate evidence for disease
- **LR+ 2-5**: Weak evidence for disease
- **LR+ < 2**: Minimal diagnostic value

- **LR- ≤ 0.1**: Strong evidence against disease
- **LR- 0.1-0.2**: Moderate evidence against disease
- **LR- 0.2-0.5**: Weak evidence against disease
- **LR- > 0.5**: Minimal diagnostic value

### Clinical Context Recommendations

#### Cancer Screening
- **Priority**: High sensitivity (≥ 0.90)
- **Acceptable**: Lower specificity (≥ 0.70)
- **Rationale**: Missing cancer cases has severe consequences

#### Diagnostic Confirmation
- **Priority**: High specificity (≥ 0.90)
- **Acceptable**: Moderate sensitivity (≥ 0.80)
- **Rationale**: Avoid unnecessary treatments/anxiety

#### Prognosis Assessment
- **Priority**: Balanced accuracy
