# Overview

This guide explains when and how to use **Decision Trees** vs **Markov Chain Models** for medical decision analysis and cost-effectiveness research. Both methods are implemented in the ClinicoPath jamovi module.

# Decision Tree Analysis

## What is a Decision Tree?

A decision tree is a graphical representation of a decision problem that maps out:

- **Decision nodes** (squares): Choice points where decisions are made
- **Chance nodes** (circles): Probabilistic events beyond our control  
- **Terminal nodes** (triangles): Final outcomes with associated costs and utilities

## Example: Acute Appendicitis Treatment

**Clinical Question:** Should a patient with suspected appendicitis receive immediate surgery or conservative treatment?

### Decision Tree Structure

```
DECISION NODE (□): Treatment Choice
├── Surgery (immediate)
│   ├── CHANCE NODE (○): Surgery Outcome  
│   │   ├── Success (96%) → TERMINAL (△): Cost $12,000, Utility 0.95
│   │   └── Complications (4%) → TERMINAL (△): Cost $20,000, Utility 0.85
│   
└── Conservative Treatment
    ├── CHANCE NODE (○): Conservative Outcome
    │   ├── Success (70%) → TERMINAL (△): Cost $3,000, Utility 0.90  
    │   └── Failure (30%) → Emergency Surgery → TERMINAL (△): Cost $18,000, Utility 0.75
```

### Results Interpretation

| Strategy | Expected Cost | Expected Utility | Cost per QALY |
|----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Surgery | $12,315 | 0.989 QALYs | $12,457 |
| Conservative | $7,454 | 0.895 QALYs | $8,330 |

**ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio):**

- Incremental Cost: $4,861
- Incremental Utility: 0.094 QALYs  
- **ICER: $51,744 per QALY**

### Clinical Interpretation

- Surgery costs $4,861 more but provides 0.094 additional QALYs
- At $51,744/QALY, surgery is marginally cost-effective (threshold typically $50,000-$100,000/QALY)
- **Recommendation:** Consider patient-specific factors (age, comorbidities, preferences)

# Markov Chain Analysis

## What is a Markov Chain Model?

A Markov model tracks a population through different **health states** over time, where:

- Patients can transition between states each cycle (e.g., annually)
- Transition probabilities depend only on current state (not history)  
- Each state has associated costs and quality of life values

## Example: Chronic Heart Disease Management

**Clinical Question:** What is the long-term cost-effectiveness of different heart disease management strategies over 20 years?

### Markov States

1. **Asymptomatic** Heart Disease
2. **Symptomatic** Heart Disease
3. **Heart Failure** 
4. **Death** (absorbing state)

### Transition Matrix (Standard Care)

```
From/To          Asymptomatic  Symptomatic  Heart Failure  Death
Asymptomatic         88.4%        10.0%         0.0%       1.5%
Symptomatic           0.0%        77.2%        19.8%       3.0%
Heart Failure         0.0%         0.0%        84.5%      15.5%
Death                 0.0%         0.0%         0.0%     100.0%
```

### Population Progression Over Time

| Year | Asymptomatic | Symptomatic | Heart Failure | Death |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| 0 | 100.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% |
| 5 | 54.0% | 23.8% | 11.5% | 10.6% |
| 10 | 29.2% | 19.4% | 21.3% | 30.1% |
| 15 | 15.8% | 12.3% | 20.7% | 51.2% |
| 20 | 8.5% | 7.1% | 15.9% | 68.4% |

### Cost-Effectiveness Results (20 years)

- **Total Lifetime Cost:** $120,561
- **Total Lifetime QALYs:** 8.39
- **Cost per QALY:** $14,370

### Clinical Interpretation

- Standard care provides good value at $14,370/QALY (well below cost-effectiveness threshold)
- 68% of patients die within 20 years, highlighting disease severity
- Peak heart failure prevalence occurs around year 15 (20.7%)
- Early intervention may be valuable given rapid disease progression

# When to Use Each Method

## Decision Tree Applications

**Best for:**

- ✅ **Acute conditions** (appendicitis, trauma, infections)
- ✅ **One-time decisions** (surgery vs. medication)
- ✅ **Short-term outcomes** (days to months)
- ✅ **Simple comparisons** (2-3 treatment options)
- ✅ **Emergency decisions** with immediate consequences

**Examples:**

- Should this patient get emergency surgery?
- Which diagnostic test should be ordered?
- Should we vaccinate this population?
- Is screening cost-effective for this age group?

## Markov Chain Applications

**Best for:**

- ✅ **Chronic diseases** (diabetes, heart disease, cancer)
- ✅ **Long-term analysis** (years to lifetime)  
- ✅ **Disease progression** modeling
- ✅ **Complex interventions** with ongoing effects
- ✅ **Policy decisions** affecting populations

**Examples:**

- What's the lifetime value of diabetes management?
- How cost-effective are cancer screening programs?
- Should we implement population-wide interventions?
- What's the optimal timing for treatment intensification?

# Practical Implementation Guide

## Using Decision Trees in jamovi

### Data Setup

Variables needed:

- Decision variables (treatment options)
- Probability variables (success rates, complication rates)
- Cost variables (treatment costs, complication costs)
- Utility variables (quality of life outcomes)

### Analysis Steps

1. Select "Decision Tree" type
2. Assign variables to appropriate roles
3. Configure display options (show probabilities, costs, utilities)
4. Run analysis and interpret expected values

### Key Outputs

- **Tree visualization** showing decision structure
- **Expected values table** with costs and utilities
- **ICER calculations** for cost-effectiveness
- **Sensitivity analysis** (optional)

## Using Markov Chains in jamovi

### Data Setup

Variables needed:

- Health state variables (disease stages)
- Transition probability variables (between states)
- State-specific costs (annual costs per state)
- State-specific utilities (quality of life per state)
- Time parameters (cycle length, time horizon)

### Analysis Steps

1. Select "Markov Model" type
2. Define health states and transition probabilities
3. Set time horizon and cycle length
4. Configure discounting (typically 3-5% annually)
5. Run cohort simulation

### Key Outputs

- **Transition matrix** showing movement between states
- **Cohort trace** showing population over time
- **Cost-effectiveness** results with lifetime totals
- **State transition plots** visualizing progression

# Key Concepts and Interpretation

## Cost-Effectiveness Metrics

**ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio):**

```
ICER = (Cost_A - Cost_B) / (Effect_A - Effect_B)
```

- **< $50,000/QALY:** Generally cost-effective
- **$50,000-$100,000/QALY:** Moderately cost-effective  
- **> $100,000/QALY:** Not cost-effective (U.S. standards)

**Net Benefit:**

```
Net Benefit = (Utility × WTP_Threshold) - Cost
```

- Positive values indicate cost-effectiveness
- Easier to compare multiple strategies

## Quality Measures

**QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years):**

- Combines quantity and quality of life
- 1.0 = perfect health for one year
- 0.0 = death or health state equivalent to death
- Allows comparison across different conditions

**Utilities:**

- 1.0 = Perfect health
- 0.8-0.9 = Mild symptoms/limitations  
- 0.6-0.8 = Moderate impairment
- 0.4-0.6 = Severe limitations
- < 0.4 = Very poor quality of life

## Time Considerations

**Discounting:**

- Future costs and benefits are worth less than present ones
- Standard rates: 3-5% annually
- Applied to both costs and utilities
- More important for long-term Markov models

**Time Horizon:**

- Decision trees: Usually < 1 year
- Markov models: Often lifetime or 10-50 years
- Should capture all relevant long-term effects

# Advanced Applications

## Combined Approaches

Some complex problems benefit from both methods:

1. **Initial Decision Tree:** Choose immediate treatment
2. **Subsequent Markov Model:** Model long-term consequences

**Example: Cancer Treatment**

- Decision tree: Surgery vs. chemotherapy vs. radiation
- Markov model: Long-term survival and quality of life

## Sensitivity Analysis

**One-way sensitivity analysis:**

- Vary one parameter at a time
- Show impact on cost-effectiveness
- Identify key drivers of results

**Probabilistic sensitivity analysis:**

- Vary all parameters simultaneously
- Account for uncertainty in all inputs
- Provide confidence intervals for results

## Advanced Markov Features

**State rewards:**

- Costs/utilities accumulated while in states
- vs. transition rewards (one-time costs/utilities)

**Tunnel states:**

- Temporary states with time-dependent properties
- Useful for modeling treatment effects

**Multiple cohorts:**

- Compare different starting populations
- Analyze subgroup differences

# Conclusion

1. **Decision trees** excel for acute, one-time decisions with short-term outcomes
2. **Markov chains** are essential for chronic disease management and long-term policy analysis
