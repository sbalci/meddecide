# Introduction

The Screening Test Calculator is a powerful tool for understanding how diagnostic test characteristics interact with disease prevalence to determine the clinical value of test results. This guide demonstrates how to use Bayes' theorem in clinical practice through realistic scenarios and sequential testing examples.

## Key Learning Objectives

After reading this guide, you will understand:

- How sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence affect predictive values
- When screening tests work well (and when they don't)
- How to interpret likelihood ratios in clinical practice
- The power of sequential testing and confirmatory tests
- Real-world applications across medical specialties

## What Makes This Calculator Special

Unlike simple calculators that just compute numbers, this tool:

- **Provides clinical context** with real-world scenarios
- **Demonstrates sequential testing** showing how probabilities update with each test
- **Includes Fagan nomograms** for visual probability assessment
- **Offers extensive example datasets** from multiple medical specialties
- **Validates inputs** and provides clinical plausibility warnings

# Understanding the Fundamentals

## Bayes' Theorem in Medicine

The screening calculator applies Bayes' theorem to medical testing:

**Prior Probability** (Prevalence) + **Test Result** → **Posterior Probability** (Predictive Value)

### Key Formulas

**Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**:
```
PPV = (Sensitivity × Prevalence) / [(Sensitivity × Prevalence) + (1-Specificity) × (1-Prevalence)]
```

**Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**:
```
NPV = (Specificity × (1-Prevalence)) / [(Specificity × (1-Prevalence)) + (1-Sensitivity) × Prevalence]
```

**Likelihood Ratios**:
```
Positive LR = Sensitivity / (1-Specificity)
Negative LR = (1-Sensitivity) / Specificity
```

## Clinical Interpretation Guidelines

| Metric | Range | Clinical Meaning |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| PPV | <10% | High false positive rate - confirmatory testing essential |
| PPV | 10-50% | Moderate confidence - consider additional testing |
| PPV | 50-80% | Good confidence - proceed with clinical follow-up |
| PPV | >80% | Excellent confidence - high likelihood of disease |
| NPV | >95% | Disease can be confidently ruled out |
| LR+ | >10 | Strong evidence for disease |
| LR+ | 5-10 | Moderate evidence for disease |
| LR+ | 2-5 | Weak evidence for disease |
| LR- | <0.1 | Strong evidence against disease |

# Example Data and Scenarios

## Loading the Example Datasets

The package includes five comprehensive datasets with realistic clinical scenarios:

```{r load-data}
# Load all screening calculator datasets
data(screening_examples)
data(prevalence_demo) 
data(performance_demo)
data(sequential_demo)
data(common_tests)

# Display overview of main clinical scenarios
kable(screening_examples[1:5, c("scenario", "setting", "sensitivity", "specificity", "prevalence", "ppv")], 
      caption = "Sample Clinical Scenarios",
      digits = 3)
```

## COVID-19 Testing Scenarios

Let's examine how COVID-19 rapid tests perform in different settings:

```{r covid-examples}
covid_data <- screening_examples[screening_examples$scenario == "COVID-19 Rapid Test", ]

kable(covid_data[, c("setting", "prevalence", "ppv", "npv", "interpretation")],
      caption = "COVID-19 Rapid Test Performance by Setting",
      digits = 3)
```

### Key Insights:

1. **Community screening** (2% prevalence): Only 26% of positive tests are true positives
2. **Outbreak testing** (15% prevalence): 78% of positive tests are true positives  
3. **Symptomatic patients** (40% prevalence): 94% of positive tests are true positives

This demonstrates the critical importance of prevalence in test interpretation!

## Cancer Screening Examples

Mammography shows the classic challenge of cancer screening:

```{r mammography-examples}
mammo_data <- screening_examples[screening_examples$scenario == "Mammography Screening", ]

kable(mammo_data[, c("setting", "prevalence", "sensitivity", "specificity", "ppv", "npv")],
      caption = "Mammography Performance by Age Group", 
      digits = 3)
```

Even with good test characteristics (80-85% sensitivity, 88-92% specificity), PPV remains low due to low cancer prevalence. This explains why positive mammograms require tissue confirmation.

# Prevalence Effects: The Most Important Concept

## Demonstration with Fixed Test Performance

```{r prevalence-effect, fig.cap="How prevalence dramatically affects PPV"}
# Use the prevalence demo data
prevalence_plot_data <- prevalence_demo %>%
  select(prevalence, ppv, npv) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = c(ppv, npv), names_to = "metric", values_to = "value")

ggplot(prevalence_plot_data, aes(x = prevalence, y = value, color = metric)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0, 1)) +
  labs(title = "How Disease Prevalence Affects Predictive Values",
       subtitle = "Fixed test performance: Sensitivity = 90%, Specificity = 90%",
       x = "Disease Prevalence (log scale)",
       y = "Predictive Value", 
       color = "Metric") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Critical Clinical Lessons

1. **In low prevalence settings**: Even excellent tests have poor PPV
2. **NPV remains high** across most prevalence ranges
3. **Screening vs. diagnostic contexts** require different interpretation
4. **Sequential testing** can dramatically improve diagnostic accuracy

# Sequential Testing: The Power of Multiple Tests

## HIV Testing Example

HIV testing demonstrates the power of sequential testing:

```{r hiv-sequential}
hiv_data <- screening_examples[screening_examples$scenario == "HIV Testing", ]

kable(hiv_data[, c("setting", "prevalence", "ppv", "clinical_action")],
      caption = "HIV Testing: From Screening to Confirmation",
      digits = 3)
```

The progression from 9% PPV (general population screening) to >99% (confirmatory testing) shows how sequential testing transforms diagnostic certainty.

## Mathematical Progression

```{r sequential-calculation}
# Show how probability evolves through testing
sequential_data <- sequential_demo

kable(sequential_data[, c("test_sequence", "final_probability")],
      caption = "Disease Probability Evolution Through Sequential Testing",
      digits = 3)
```

```{r sequential-plot, fig.cap="Sequential testing dramatically changes disease probability"}
ggplot(sequential_data, aes(x = test_sequence, y = final_probability)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(final_probability * 100, 1), "%")), 
            vjust = -0.5, size = 4) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0, 1)) +
  labs(title = "Disease Probability After Sequential Testing",
       subtitle = "Sensitivity = 85%, Specificity = 90%, Initial Prevalence = 10%",
       x = "Test Sequence Pattern",
       y = "Final Disease Probability") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

  False_Positive_Rate = c("N/A", "93%", "8%")
)

kable(breast_pathway, caption = "Breast Cancer: From Screening to Diagnosis")
```

## Outbreak Investigation Scenarios

During disease outbreaks, prevalence changes dramatically:

)

kable(outbreak_data, 
      caption = "COVID-19 Testing Strategy by Outbreak Phase",
      digits = 2)
```

# Statistical Concepts and Calculations

## Understanding Likelihood Ratios

Likelihood ratios quantify how much a test result changes disease probability:

```{r lr-interpretation}
lr_guide <- data.frame(
  LR_Positive = c(">10", "5-10", "2-5", "1-2", "<1"),
  Evidence_For = c("Strong", "Moderate", "Weak", "Minimal", "Against"),
  LR_Negative = c("<0.1", "0.1-0.2", "0.2-0.5", "0.5-1", ">1"),
  Evidence_Against = c("Strong", "Moderate", "Weak", "Minimal", "For")
)

kable(lr_guide, caption = "Likelihood Ratio Interpretation Guide")
```

## Probability Conversion

Converting between odds and probabilities:

```{r probability-conversion}
conversion_examples <- data.frame(
  Probability = c(0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.90),
  Odds = c("1:99", "1:19", "1:9", "1:3", "1:1", "3:1", "9:1"),
  Clinical_Context = c("Rare disease", "Uncommon", "Screening", "Symptomatic", "50-50", "Likely", "Very likely")
)

kable(conversion_examples, caption = "Probability to Odds Conversion Examples")
```

# Case Studies

## Case Study 1: PSA Screening Dilemma

**Scenario**: 55-year-old man with elevated PSA (4.5 ng/mL)

**Test Characteristics**:
- Sensitivity: 70%
- Specificity: 80%  
- Prevalence in this age group: 3%

**Calculations**:
```{r psa-case}
psa_ppv <- (0.70 * 0.03) / ((0.70 * 0.03) + (0.20 * 0.97))
psa_npv <- (0.80 * 0.97) / ((0.80 * 0.97) + (0.30 * 0.03))

cat("PSA Screening Results:\n")
cat("PPV =", round(psa_ppv * 100, 1), "%\n")
cat("NPV =", round(psa_npv * 100, 1), "%\n")
cat("\nClinical Interpretation:\n")
cat("- Only", round(psa_ppv * 100, 1), "% of positive PSA tests indicate cancer\n")
cat("- Tissue biopsy needed for confirmation\n")
cat("- Consider patient preferences and comorbidities\n")
```

## Case Study 2: COVID-19 Contact Tracing

**Scenario**: Contact of confirmed COVID-19 case, asymptomatic

**Initial rapid test**: Negative
**Question**: How confident can we be that they don't have COVID-19?

```{r covid-contact}
# Scenario parameters
covid_sens <- 0.85
covid_spec <- 0.95
covid_prev_contact <- 0.15  # Higher prevalence as a contact

# Calculate NPV
covid_npv <- (covid_spec * (1 - covid_prev_contact)) / 
             ((covid_spec * (1 - covid_prev_contact)) + ((1 - covid_sens) * covid_prev_contact))

cat("COVID-19 Contact Tracing:\n")
cat("Negative rapid test NPV =", round(covid_npv * 100, 1), "%\n")
cat("Probability of disease despite negative test =", round((1-covid_npv) * 100, 1), "%\n")
cat("\nRecommendation: Consider repeat testing or quarantine period\n")
```

# Troubleshooting and Common Mistakes

## Common Input Errors

### 1. **Confusing Sensitivity and Specificity**
- **Sensitivity**: How often the test is positive when disease is present
- **Specificity**: How often the test is negative when disease is absent

### 2. **Using Wrong Prevalence**
- **Population prevalence**: For screening scenarios
- **Clinical prevalence**: For symptomatic patients  
- **Post-test prevalence**: For sequential testing

### 3. **Misinterpreting Results**
- **PPV depends heavily on prevalence**
- **NPV is often high even for poor tests**
- **Likelihood ratios are prevalence-independent**

## Clinical Pitfalls

### 1. **Over-relying on Screening Tests**
Remember: Low prevalence = Low PPV, even for good tests

### 2. **Ignoring Pre-test Probability**
Clinical assessment should always inform test interpretation

### 3. **Stopping After One Test**
Sequential testing often dramatically improves diagnostic accuracy

## Technical Issues

### Input Validation Messages
The calculator will warn you about:
- Unrealistic test characteristics
- Extreme prevalence values
- Clinically implausible combinations

### Mathematical Edge Cases
- Perfect specificity → Infinite positive LR
- Zero specificity → Infinite negative LR  
- Extreme prevalence → Undefined predictive values

  Strategy = c("Test A alone", "Test B alone", "Either positive", "Both positive"),
  Sensitivity = c(0.80, 0.70, 0.94, 0.56),
  Specificity = c(0.90, 0.95, 0.86, 0.99),
  Clinical_Use = c("Standard approach", "Alternative test", "High sensitivity", "High specificity")
)

kable(parallel_example, caption = "Parallel Testing Strategies")
```
