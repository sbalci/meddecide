# Introduction

The **Diagnostic Style Clustering** feature in ClinicoPath implements the methodology from Usubutun et al. (2012) to identify diagnostic "schools" or "styles" among pathologists. This powerful analysis reveals whether pathologists cluster based on:

- **Training institution** (e.g., different medical schools create distinct diagnostic approaches)
- **Experience level** (junior vs. senior pathologists)  
- **Geographic region** (regional diagnostic preferences)
- **Specialty focus** (generalist vs. specialist approaches)
- **Institutional culture** (academic vs. community practice patterns)

## Clinical Significance

Understanding diagnostic styles is crucial for:

1. **Quality Assurance**: Identifying systematic biases in diagnostic patterns
2. **Training Programs**: Recognizing the influence of different educational approaches
3. **Consensus Development**: Understanding why certain cases generate disagreement
4. **Standardization Efforts**: Targeting training to reduce style-based variation
5. **Case Consultation**: Selecting appropriate experts based on diagnostic philosophy

## The Usubutun 2012 Study

The original study analyzed endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) diagnoses among 20 pathologists and found **three distinct diagnostic styles** that correlated with training background and diagnostic philosophy. This methodology has been adapted for various pathology subspecialties.

# Getting Started

## Data Requirements

Your dataset should contain:

**Required:**
- **Multiple rater columns**: Each column represents one pathologist's diagnoses
- **Case identifiers**: Unique identifier for each case

**Optional but Recommended:**
- **Pathologist characteristics**: Experience, training institution, current institution, specialty
- **True diagnoses**: Gold standard for accuracy assessment
- **Case features**: Difficulty level, confounding factors

## Example Dataset Structure

```{r dataset_structure, echo=FALSE}
# Example data structure
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)

example_data <- data.frame(
  case_id = paste0("Case_", 1:5),
  true_diagnosis = c("Benign", "EIN", "Carcinoma", "Benign", "EIN"),
  Path_01 = c("Benign", "EIN", "Carcinoma", "Benign", "Benign"),
  Path_02 = c("Benign", "Benign", "Carcinoma", "EIN", "EIN"),
  Path_03 = c("EIN", "EIN", "Carcinoma", "Benign", "EIN"),
  difficulty = c("Easy", "Moderate", "Easy", "Difficult", "Moderate")
)

kable(example_data, caption = "Example Dataset Structure for Diagnostic Style Analysis")
```

# Analysis Walkthrough

## Dataset 1: Endometrial Pathology (Classic Usubutun Study)

Let's demonstrate the analysis using synthetic data modeled after the original study.

```{r load_endometrial_data, eval=FALSE}
# Load the endometrial diagnostic styles dataset

data("endometrial_diagnostic_styles")

# View structure
head(endometrial_diagnostic_styles$diagnosis_data)
head(endometrial_diagnostic_styles$pathologist_info)
```

### Step 1: Basic Agreement Analysis

Start with standard interrater reliability:

**jamovi Instructions:**
1. Open the endometrial_diagnostic_styles.csv file
2. Go to **meddecide** → **Agreement** → **Interrater Reliability**
3. Select pathologist columns (Path_01 through Path_15) as **Raters/Observers**
4. Check **Show Interpretation Guidelines**
5. Check **Pairwise Rater Analysis**

**Expected Results:**
- Overall agreement: ~65-75%
- Fleiss' Kappa: 0.60-0.72 (substantial agreement)
- Individual pathologist accuracies vary by experience

### Step 2: Enable Diagnostic Style Clustering

Enable the core diagnostic style analysis:

**jamovi Instructions:**
1. Check **Diagnostic Style Clustering (Usubutun Method)**
2. Set clustering parameters:
   - **Style Clustering Method**: Ward's Linkage (default)
   - **Style Distance Metric**: Percentage Agreement (default)
   - **Number of Style Groups**: 3 (as found in original study)

**Expected Results:**
- **3 distinct diagnostic styles** identified
- Style 1: Conservative (tend to undercall EIN)
- Style 2: Moderate (balanced approach)  
- Style 3: Aggressive (more likely to diagnose EIN)

### Step 3: Include Rater Characteristics

Add pathologist background information:

**jamovi Instructions:**
1. Check **Include Rater Characteristics**
2. Select characteristic variables:
   - **Experience Variable**: experience_level
   - **Training Institution Variable**: training_institution
   - **Current Institution Variable**: current_institution
   - **Specialty Variable**: specialty_focus

**Expected Results:**
- **Style 1** (Conservative): Predominantly community pathologists, general practice
- **Style 2** (Moderate): Mix of academic and community, mid-level experience
- **Style 3** (Aggressive): Academic specialists, gynecologic pathology focus

### Step 4: Identify Discordant Cases

Find cases that distinguish diagnostic styles:

**jamovi Instructions:**
1. Check **Identify Discordant Cases**

**Expected Results:**
- Cases with polyps show high inter-style disagreement
- Hormonal effect cases distinguish conservative vs. aggressive styles
- Poor quality preparations increase random disagreement

# Visualization Guide

## Dendrogram Plot

The **Diagnostic Style Dendrogram** shows hierarchical clustering of pathologists:

**Key Features:**
- **Branch height**: Distance between pathologists/groups
- **Groupings**: Clear separation indicates distinct styles
- **Outliers**: Pathologists that don't fit cleanly into groups

**Interpretation:**
- **Short branches within groups**: High similarity within diagnostic styles
- **Long branches between groups**: Clear separation of diagnostic approaches
- **Branch order**: Pathologists cluster by diagnostic similarity, not alphabetically

## Style Heatmap

The **Diagnostic Style Heatmap** visualizes diagnostic patterns:

**Key Features:**
- **Rows**: Pathologists (grouped by style)
- **Columns**: Diagnostic categories
- **Colors**: Frequency of each diagnosis (blue=low, red=high)
- **Patterns**: Style groups show similar color patterns

**Interpretation:**
- **Conservative styles**: More blue in aggressive categories (EIN, Carcinoma)
- **Aggressive styles**: More red in higher-grade categories
- **Consistent patterns within groups**: Confirms style group validity

- Sample size too small
- Confounding variables present

**Solutions:**
- Collect additional characteristic variables
- Increase case numbers
- Focus on cases with known diagnostic challenges
- Consider interaction between characteristics

### Issue: Poor within-group agreement

**Likely Causes:**
- Inappropriate number of style groups
- High random diagnostic error
- Case mix not suitable for style analysis

**Solutions:**
- Adjust number of style groups
- Focus on cases with moderate diagnostic difficulty
- Exclude cases with technical problems
- Use expert consensus gold standard

### Issue: No discordant cases identified

**Likely Causes:**
- Style groups too similar
- Cases too easy/too difficult
- Limited diagnostic options

**Solutions:**
- Include cases across difficulty spectrum
- Ensure adequate sample of borderline cases
- Use cases known to generate disagreement
- Lower discordant case threshold

# Conclusion

The Diagnostic Style Clustering feature provides a powerful tool for understanding patterns of diagnostic disagreement among pathologists. By identifying diagnostic "schools" or "styles," this analysis offers insights into:

- **Quality improvement opportunities**
- **Training program effectiveness**  
- **Consensus development priorities**
- **Expert consultation strategies**

The methodology, based on the seminal Usubutun et al. (2012) study, has broad applications across pathology subspecialties and can inform evidence-based approaches to reducing diagnostic variation.

Remember that diagnostic style differences often reflect legitimate variations in clinical judgment rather than errors. The goal is not to eliminate all variation, but to understand its sources and ensure that diagnostic approaches are appropriate, consistent, and well-reasoned.
