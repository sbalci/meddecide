# Introduction

This vignette demonstrates the advanced features of the `agreement` function in ClinicoPath, focusing on specialized analysis methods for pathology applications. These features go beyond basic kappa statistics to provide insights into diagnostic patterns, rater characteristics, and pathology-specific metrics.

## Key Advanced Features

-   **Diagnostic Style Clustering** (Usubutun et al. 2012 method)
-   **Pathology-Specific Analysis** with diagnostic accuracy metrics
-   **Krippendorff's Alpha** for complex data types
-   **Outlier Case Analysis** for quality improvement
-   **Rater Characteristic Analysis** for understanding bias patterns

# Dataset Overview

We'll use the `histopathology` dataset which contains ratings from multiple observers.

```{r data-overview}
# Load the histopathology dataset
data(histopathology)

# Check available rater variables
rater_vars <- c("Rater 1", "Rater 2", "Rater 3", "Rater A", "Rater B")
cat("Available rater variables and their values:\n")
for (var in rater_vars) {
  if (var %in% names(histopathology)) {
    values <- unique(histopathology[[var]])
    cat(sprintf("%s: %s\n", var, paste(values[!is.na(values)], collapse = ", ")))
  }
}

# Overview of the dataset
cat(sprintf("\nDataset: %d cases, %d variables\n", nrow(histopathology), ncol(histopathology)))
```

# Basic Agreement Analysis

## Example 1: Standard Kappa Analysis

```{r basic-kappa}
# Basic agreement analysis with Cohen's kappa (2 raters)
basic_agreement <- agreement(
  data = histopathology,
  vars = c("Rater 1", "Rater 2"),
  showInterpretation = TRUE,
  heatmap = TRUE
)
```

## Example 2: Fleiss' Kappa for Multiple Raters

```{r fleiss-kappa}
# Agreement analysis with Fleiss' kappa (3+ raters)
fleiss_agreement <- agreement(
  data = histopathology,
  vars = c("Rater 1", "Rater 2", "Rater 3"),
  exct = TRUE,  # Use exact calculation
  pairwiseAnalysis = TRUE,
  categoryAnalysis = TRUE
)
```

# Advanced Reliability Measures

## Example 3: Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)

```{r icc-analysis}
# ICC analysis for ordinal data
icc_analysis <- agreement(
  data = histopathology,
  vars = c("Rater A", "Rater B"),  # Ordinal raters (1, 2, 3)
  icc = TRUE,
  iccType = "ICC2k",  # Average measures, consistency
  confidenceLevel = 0.95
)
```

## Example 4: Krippendorff's Alpha

```{r krippendorff-alpha}
# Krippendorff's alpha for generalized reliability
kripp_analysis <- agreement(
  data = histopathology,
  vars = c("Rater 1", "Rater 2", "Rater 3"),
  kripp = TRUE,
  krippMethod = "nominal",
  bootstrap = TRUE  # Bootstrap confidence intervals
)
```

# Diagnostic Style Clustering (Usubutun Method)

The Usubutun method (Usubutun et al. 2012) identifies diagnostic "schools" or "styles" among pathologists using hierarchical clustering based on diagnostic patterns.

## Example 5: Basic Diagnostic Style Analysis

```{r diagnostic-style-basic}
# Basic diagnostic style clustering
style_analysis <- agreement(
  data = histopathology,
  vars = c("Rater 1", "Rater 2", "Rater 3", "Rater A", "Rater B"),
  diagnosticStyleAnalysis = TRUE,
  styleClusterMethod = "ward",  # Ward's linkage (original Usubutun method)
  styleDistanceMetric = "agreement",  # Percentage agreement distance
  numberOfStyleGroups = 3
)
```

## Example 6: Advanced Style Analysis with Rater Characteristics

```{r diagnostic-style-advanced}
# Advanced style analysis including rater characteristics
advanced_style <- agreement(
  data = histopathology,
  vars = c("Rater 1", "Rater 2", "Rater 3", "Rater A", "Rater B"),
  diagnosticStyleAnalysis = TRUE,
  styleClusterMethod = "ward",
  styleDistanceMetric = "agreement",
  numberOfStyleGroups = 3,
  identifyDiscordantCases = TRUE,
  raterCharacteristics = TRUE,
  experienceVar = "Age",      # Use Age as proxy for experience
  trainingVar = "Group",      # Use Group as proxy for training background
  institutionVar = "Race",    # Use Race as proxy for institution
  specialtyVar = "Sex"        # Use Sex as proxy for specialty
)
```

## Example 7: Different Clustering Methods Comparison

```{r clustering-methods}
# Compare different clustering methods
clustering_methods <- c("ward", "complete", "average")
distance_metrics <- c("agreement", "correlation", "euclidean")

# Ward's method with agreement distance (original Usubutun)
usubutun_original <- agreement(
  data = histopathology,
  vars = c("Rater 1", "Rater 2", "Rater 3"),
  diagnosticStyleAnalysis = TRUE,
  styleClusterMethod = "ward",
  styleDistanceMetric = "agreement",
  numberOfStyleGroups = 3
)

# Complete linkage with correlation distance
complete_corr <- agreement(
  data = histopathology,
  vars = c("Rater 1", "Rater 2", "Rater 3"),
  diagnosticStyleAnalysis = TRUE,
  styleClusterMethod = "complete",
  styleDistanceMetric = "correlation",
  numberOfStyleGroups = 3
)
```

# Pathology-Specific Analysis

## Example 8: Diagnostic Accuracy Analysis

```{r pathology-context}
# Pathology-specific analysis with gold standard
pathology_analysis <- agreement(
  data = histopathology,
  vars = c("Rater 1", "Rater 2", "Rater 3"),
  pathologyContext = TRUE,
  diagnosisVar = "Outcome",  # Gold standard diagnosis
  categoryAnalysis = TRUE,
  outlierAnalysis = TRUE
)
```

## Example 9: Biomarker Scoring Agreement

```{r biomarker-scoring}
# Simulate biomarker scoring data for demonstration
set.seed(123)
biomarker_data <- data.frame(
  case_id = 1:100,
  pathologist_1 = sample(0:3, 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1)),
  pathologist_2 = sample(0:3, 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.25, 0.35, 0.3, 0.1)),
  pathologist_3 = sample(0:3, 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.1)),
  gold_standard = sample(0:3, 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.1))
)

# Agreement analysis for biomarker scoring
biomarker_agreement <- agreement(
  data = biomarker_data,
  vars = c("pathologist_1", "pathologist_2", "pathologist_3"),
  wght = "squared",  # Weighted kappa for ordinal scores
  pathologyContext = TRUE,
  diagnosisVar = "gold_standard",
  categoryAnalysis = TRUE,
  confidenceLevel = 0.95
)
```

# Outlier and Quality Control Analysis

## Example 10: Identifying Problematic Cases

```{r outlier-analysis}
# Comprehensive outlier analysis
outlier_analysis <- agreement(
  data = histopathology,
  vars = c("Rater 1", "Rater 2", "Rater 3", "Rater A", "Rater B"),
  outlierAnalysis = TRUE,
  diagnosticStyleAnalysis = TRUE,
  identifyDiscordantCases = TRUE,
  pathologyContext = TRUE
)
```

## Example 11: Quality Assurance Monitoring

```{r qa-monitoring}
# Create synthetic QA data for demonstration
set.seed(456)
qa_data <- data.frame(
  case_id = 1:200,
  staff_pathologist = sample(c("Benign", "Malignant", "Atypical"), 200, 
                           replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.6, 0.3, 0.1)),
  resident_month_1 = sample(c("Benign", "Malignant", "Atypical"), 200, 
                          replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.35, 0.15)),
  resident_month_6 = sample(c("Benign", "Malignant", "Atypical"), 200, 
                          replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.58, 0.32, 0.1)),

                             replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.65, 0.28, 0.07))
)

  pathologyContext = TRUE,
  diagnosisVar = "consensus_diagnosis",
  pairwiseAnalysis = TRUE,
  categoryAnalysis = TRUE,
  outlierAnalysis = TRUE,
  showInterpretation = TRUE
)
```

# Weighted Kappa for Ordinal Data

## Example 12: Grading Agreement with Weighted Kappa

```{r weighted-kappa}
# Create tumor grading data
grading_data <- data.frame(
  case_id = 1:150,
  pathologist_1 = sample(1:3, 150, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.4, 0.4, 0.2)),
  pathologist_2 = sample(1:3, 150, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.35, 0.45, 0.2)),
  expert_consensus = sample(1:3, 150, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.5, 0.2))
)

# Convert to ordered factors for proper weighted kappa
grading_data$pathologist_1 <- factor(grading_data$pathologist_1, 
                                    levels = 1:3, ordered = TRUE)
grading_data$pathologist_2 <- factor(grading_data$pathologist_2, 
                                    levels = 1:3, ordered = TRUE)
grading_data$expert_consensus <- factor(grading_data$expert_consensus, 
                                       levels = 1:3, ordered = TRUE)

# Weighted kappa analysis
weighted_analysis <- agreement(
  data = grading_data,
  vars = c("pathologist_1", "pathologist_2"),
  wght = "squared",  # Squared weights for ordinal data
  pathologyContext = TRUE,
  diagnosisVar = "expert_consensus",
  categoryAnalysis = TRUE,
  confidenceLevel = 0.95
)
```

# Complex Multi-Rater Scenarios

## Example 13: Comprehensive Multi-Rater Study

# Comprehensive analysis with all features
comprehensive_analysis <- agreement(
  data = histopathology,
  vars = c("Rater 1", "Rater 2", "Rater 3", "Rater A", "Rater B"),
  
  # Basic agreement measures

  categoryAnalysis = TRUE,
  outlierAnalysis = TRUE,
  
  # Diagnostic style clustering
  diagnosticStyleAnalysis = TRUE,
  styleClusterMethod = "ward",
  styleDistanceMetric = "agreement",
  numberOfStyleGroups = 3,

  raterCharacteristics = TRUE,
  
  # Visualization and interpretation
  heatmap = TRUE,

)
```

# Interpretation and Clinical Applications

## Understanding Diagnostic Style Results

The diagnostic style clustering analysis (Usubutun method) provides insights into:

1.  **Style Groups**: Identification of pathologists who share similar diagnostic patterns
2.  **Experience Patterns**: Whether diagnostic styles correlate with experience levels
3.  **Training Effects**: Whether pathologists from similar training backgrounds cluster together
4.  **Institutional Bias**: Whether pathologists from the same institution show similar patterns
5.  **Discordant Cases**: Specific cases that distinguish different diagnostic styles

## Clinical Applications

### Quality Assurance

-   Monitor consistency between pathologists
-   Identify cases requiring consensus review
-   Track improvement in training programs

### Research Applications

-   Validate new diagnostic criteria
-   Assess inter-observer reliability in clinical trials
-   Study sources of diagnostic variation

### Education

-   Identify learning objectives for residents
-   Monitor progress in diagnostic skills
-   Compare different training approaches

# Best Practices

## Data Preparation

1.  **Ensure Complete Cases**: Remove cases with missing ratings
2.  **Standardize Categories**: Use consistent diagnostic categories across raters
3.  **Appropriate Sample Size**: Minimum 50 cases for reliable kappa estimates

## Analysis Selection

1.  **Cohen's vs Fleiss' Kappa**: Use Cohen's for 2 raters, Fleiss' for 3+
2.  **Weighted Kappa**: Use for ordinal data (grades, stages)
3.  **ICC**: Use for continuous or ordinal measurements
4.  **Krippendorff's Alpha**: Use for complex designs or missing data

## Interpretation Guidelines

### Kappa Values

-   **\< 0.20**: Poor agreement
-   **0.21-0.40**: Fair agreement\
-   **0.41-0.60**: Moderate agreement
-   **0.61-0.80**: Substantial agreement
-   **0.81-1.00**: Almost perfect agreement

### Clinical Significance

-   Consider both statistical significance and clinical importance
-   Account for prevalence effects in interpretation
-   Use confidence intervals for decision making

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

1.  **Low Agreement**: Check for systematic bias, category definitions, or training needs
2.  **Convergence Problems**: Reduce model complexity or increase sample size
3.  **Missing Data**: Use appropriate handling methods or Krippendorff's alpha

## Performance Optimization

1.  **Large Datasets**: Use sampling for diagnostic style analysis
2.  **Many Raters**: Consider pairwise analysis first
3.  **Complex Models**: Start with basic analysis before adding advanced features
