        Medical Decision Calculator for diagnostic test evaluation when you have 
        the four key counts: True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True 
        Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN). Calculates comprehensive 
        diagnostic performance metrics including sensitivity, specificity, 
        positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios, and 
        post-test probabilities. Supports confidence interval estimation and 
        Fagan nomogram visualization for clinical decision making.

              FN = 10,  # False negatives  
              TN = 80,  # True negatives
              FP = 20   # False positives
            )
            
            # Include 95% confidence intervals
