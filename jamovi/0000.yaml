  A comprehensive toolkit for medical decision analysis and reliability
  assessment, implemented as a jamovi module. The package provides tools for:
  * Interrater and intrarater reliability analysis using Cohen's Kappa and
    Fleiss' Kappa statistics
  * Diagnostic test evaluation with sensitivity, specificity, predictive values,
    and likelihood ratios
  * Sample size calculations for reliability studies using confidence interval
    and power-based approaches
  * Visualization tools including Fagan nomograms for Bayesian probability
    updates
  * Power analysis for interobserver agreement studies with support for
    multiple raters and outcome categories
  Tools are provided through an intuitive graphical interface in jamovi, making
  complex medical decision analyses accessible to clinical researchers.

      Medical Decision Calculator for diagnostic test evaluation when you have 
      the four key counts: True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True 
      Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN). Calculates comprehensive 
      diagnostic performance metrics including sensitivity, specificity, 
      positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios, and 
      post-test probabilities. Supports confidence interval estimation and 
      Fagan nomogram visualization for clinical decision making.
