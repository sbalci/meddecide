description: |-
  A comprehensive toolkit for medical decision analysis and reliability
  assessment, implemented as a jamovi module. The package provides tools for:
  * Interrater and intrarater reliability analysis using Cohen's Kappa and
    Fleiss' Kappa statistics
  * Diagnostic test evaluation with sensitivity, specificity, predictive values,
    and likelihood ratios
  * Sample size calculations for reliability studies using confidence interval
    and power-based approaches
  * Visualization tools including Fagan nomograms for Bayesian probability
    updates
  * Power analysis for interobserver agreement studies with support for
    multiple raters and outcome categories
  Tools are provided through an intuitive graphical interface in jamovi, making
  complex medical decision analyses accessible to clinical researchers.

    description: >
      Analysis of diagnostic tests without a gold standard reference using
      multiple statistical approaches. Implements Latent Class Analysis (Hui &
      Walter, 1980), Bayesian methods (Joseph et al., 1995),  and composite
      reference standards for estimating test performance when no perfect
      reference test exists.

      Function for comparing multiple Medical Decision Tests. Compares
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive
      value, and other metrics between different tests against the same golden
      standard. Includes statistical comparison using McNemar's test and
      confidence intervals for differences.

      evaluation. Includes ROC curve analysis, Youden Index optimization, 
      sensitivity/specificity analysis, optimal cutoff determination, and 
      comparative ROC analysis. Essential for biomarker validation, diagnostic
      test evaluation, and clinical decision support in medical research.

      Analyzes how diagnostic accuracy changes when applying two tests in
      sequence,

      comparing three different testing strategies: serial positive
      (confirmation),

      serial negative (exclusion), and parallel testing. Provides comprehensive

      analysis including population flow, cost implications, and Fagan
      nomograms.
